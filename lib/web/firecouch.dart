     * Firecouch uses a queueing system for simultaneous operations to protect the

     *
     * For example, every time a write is to be performed, a slot is requested in
     * the queue and if one is available it is reserved during the operation.
     *
     * The queue can be given limits and a strategy can be defined for how to deal
     * with the situation if capacity is ever reached.
     *
     * Capacity is typically reached for one of two reasons:
     *
     *  1. Failure to await calls to `set`.
     *  2. A large number of intentional simultaneous writes.
     *
     * Reason #1 is easily solved by simply `await`ing consecutive calls to `set`.
     *
     * Reason #2 is more challenging to solve. It requires managing the flow of
     * writes or allowing loss of data.
     *
     *  * Managing the flow can be done by either bulking operations or attempting
     * to smooth out peaks and valleys in data rates if having instantaneous
     * writes isn't important.
     *  * Allowing loss of data can be achieved by using the `drop` strategy to
     * not write any new data whenever capacity has been reached.
     *  * A combination of both with smarter filters can be achieved by using the
     * `call` strategy and using a callback to take over management of the queue
     * when it reaches capacity.
     *
     * NOTE: This does not serve as protection from denial of service or other
     * similar attacks. Such features can only be implemented on the server itself
     * or right in front of it, before the client.
